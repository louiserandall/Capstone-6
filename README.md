# Capstone-6
Machine Learning (Supervised) - Image Processing

Create a file called mnist_task.ipynb.

● Load the MNIST dataset. You may download the files or use a library such
as Keras to access the dataset (e.g. from keras.datasets import mnist).

● Split the training data into a training and development(test) set.

○ Add a comment explaining the purpose of the train,
development(test) and test(validation) sets

● Use the RandomForestClassifier built into sklearn to create a classification
model.

● Pick one parameter to tune, and explain why you chose this parameter.

● Choose which value for the parameter to set for testing on the test data and
explain why.

● Print the confusion matrix for your Random Forest model on the test set.

● Report which classes the model struggles with the most.

● Report the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score
